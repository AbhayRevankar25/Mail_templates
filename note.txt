Thank you for taking the time to review this assignment. Please feel free to explore the implementation in detail.

Key enhancements made in the project:
The application now accepts input files in various formats (PDF, Markdown, and TXT).

It generates two outputs:
output.json — containing the structured JSON outline of the email.
output.html — containing the styled HTML email template.


Code Structure:
index.js:
This is the primary entry point of the application. It uses a generalized prompt tailored for meeting-related messages, ensuring well-formatted meeting email templates.

general_template.js:
Contains a general-purpose prompt that can handle a wide range of email types, providing flexibility for different use cases.

all_template.js:
Implements distinct prompts for specific message types — such as product descriptions, meeting agendas, and newsletter drafts — to provide highly contextual and accurate outputs.


The overall development experience was positive. The main challenge involved effective prompt engineering to ensure consistent and relevant responses from the language model.
